Previously, I've worked with the youth in events such as art/dance workshops, bakesales, teaching them certain subjects such as sciences, maths etc. I also managed the art, design or social media team under many school organizations and clubs, therefore I have experience in digital and different genres of traditional art. I understand the use of mediums and art supplies correctly and can surely help assist the youth with the same.
Iâ€™ve also conducted research on a bigger platform in the art field, thrice and continue to do so as a hobby.
Iâ€™ve done the above voluntarily and I find this job as the perfect opportunity to continue my hobbies and make a time commitment to something I would really want to do. This is the job where I can share the best of my skills with the youth and learn from them as well.
